# # [Symbolic Regression of a Linear Time Continuous Systems](@id symbolic_regression_simple)
#
# !!! note
#    Symbolic regression is using regularized evolution, simulated annealing, and gradient-free optimization to find suitable equations.
#    Hence, the performance might differ and depends strongly on the hyperparameters of the optimization.
#    This example might not recover the groundtruth, but is showing off the use within `DataDrivenDiffEq.jl`.
#
# DataDrivenDiffEq offers an interface to [`SymbolicRegression.jl`](https://ai.damtp.cam.ac.uk/symbolicregression/dev/) to infer more complex functions.

U = permutedims(sin.(0.5 * t))

# And plot the problems data.

# To solve our problem, we will use [`EQSearch`](@ref), which provides a wrapper for the [symbolic regression interface](https://astroautomata.com/SymbolicRegression.jl/v0.6/api/#Options).
# We will stick to simple operations, use a `L1DistLoss`, and limit the verbosity of the algorithm.

# Again, we `solve` the problem to obtain a [`DataDrivenSolution`](@ref). Note that any additional keyword arguments are passed onto
# symbolic regressions [`EquationSearch`](https://astroautomata.com/SymbolicRegression.jl/v0.6/api/#EquationSearch) with the exception of `niterations` which
# is `maxiters`

# We can inspect the systems metrics, here the `loglikelihood` of the result.

# !!! note
#    Currently the parameters of the result found by [`EQSearch`](@ref) are not turned into symbolic parameters.
#    This affects some functions like `dof`, `aicc`, `bic`.
